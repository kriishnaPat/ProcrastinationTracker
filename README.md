## **Third Place Winner at LightHouse Hackathon: [TimeDiscard](https://devpost.com/software/timediscard/edit)

## Inspiration
At some point in their lives, everybody procrastinates. Chronic procrastination reduces efficiency and has a negative impact on our mental health by causing anxiety and stress. As deadlines approach, it's common to feel frustrated and guilty for not getting started on a task sooner. We chose to create TimeDiscard because we were students ourselves and wanted to solve this issue.

## What it does
TimeDiscard is a perfect procrastination app that blends many strategies with a variety of features. One of the most effective production methods is the Pomodoro Technique. You can identify tasks, including subtasks and recurring tasks, and set deadlines with it. The Pomodoro technique can then be used to work through the things on your list one by one. TimeDiscard is available as a free Chrome extension.

## How we built it
We primarily used JavaScript, React.JS, TailwindCSS, Node.JS, and Framer.Motion.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a hard time debugging the extension. As well, it was a bit difficult for us to get familiar with new Chrome API features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of the piece we created and the significance it has for all of the students. Our project was incredibly challenging and included several layers.

## What we learned
All of our teammates gained a basic understanding of how extensions are created and APIs are utilized.

## What's next for TimeDiscard
We hope to add more functionality or develop an interface similar to the Forest app in the future. As well as add more features such as a goal lister that will allow users to gain more motivation to accomplish their tasks.
